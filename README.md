Solutions to project euler written in python

No docstrings as of yet.  Solutions are uploaded once they've been completed.  I'm aware of the sites preference against uploading but
as there already exist many solutions online to the first 150 or so problems this seemed harmless.  If you have any questions please notify
me.  Thanks.
